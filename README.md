## TDBS Dumper - TriangleDB iOS Spyware String Dumper
TDBS Dumper is a simple python script which can identify, dump, and decrypt protected strings from the TriangleDB iOS spyware implant. 
A special thanks to the Kaspersky team for their analysis series:  https://securelist.com/trng-2023/ <br>

## Context
TriangleDB (Operation Triangulation) was an iOS spyware campaign conducted by an unknown APT (at least publicly unknown) that targeted the Russia-based cybersecurity company, Kaspersky. TriangleDB utilized four iOS zero-days for its deployment onto iOS devices. Below is a graphic of the full attack chain provided by Kaspersky. TDBS Dumper specifically focuses on the final stage spyware implant.

As mentioned above, the TDBS Dumper aids in identifying, dumping, and decrypting protected strings from the TriangleDB iOS spyware implant. TriangleDB's spyware implant utilizes basic HEX-encoded, rolling XOR-encrypted strings, which are employed in certain Objective-C methods and functions within the implant. Below is a compiled list of the methods in question.

```
-[CRAInfo retrieveIADict] - Utilized in the implant ability to enumerate all applications on the mobile device.
      Collected Application Details:
          - applicationType  - shortVersionString
          - vendorName       - bundleContainerURL
          - path             - bundleIdentifier
          - bundleURL        - containerURL
          - dataContainerURL - localizedName
          - groupContainerURLs

-[CRConfig spinUp] - Utilized by the implant for WIFI related functions. It's refrencing the iOS WIFI manager.
      Utilized WIFI manager functions:
          - WiFiManagerClientCreate  - WiFiManagerClientCopyDevices
          - WiFiNetworkGetSSID       - WiFiNetworkGetProperty
          - WiFiDeviceClientCopyCurrentNetwork

-[CRConfig populateWithSysInfo] - Utilized to get system information to send back heartbeats to C2.
      Examples of system information:
           - UDID  - IMEI
           - MEID  - EID
           - OS Version

-[CRConfig init] - Initialization of the implant configuration.

-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture] - Self explanatory

-[CRGetIndexesV2 execute] - Seems to be related to executing SQLite queries against the iOS keychain db.
      Example strings found:
           - SELECT data FROM %@
           - SELECT keyclass, actualKeyclass, data FROM metadatakeys
           - /private/var/Keychains/keychain-2.db
```

Moving on to the protected strings within the implant. Kaspersky provided a cleaned up version on the function used to unprotect the strings. See below:
```
id +[CRConfig unmungeHexString:](id a1, SEL a2, id stringToDecrypt) {
  // code omitted
  while (1) {
	hexByte[0] = stringBytes[i];
	hexByte[1] = stringBytes[i + 1];
	encryptedByte = strtoul(hexByte, &__endptr, 16);
	if (__endptr == hexByte) 
          break;
	i += 2LL;
	if (j)
  	    decryptedString[j] = encryptedByte ^ previousByte;
	else
  	    decryptedString[0] = encryptedByte;
	++j;
	previousByte = encryptedByte;
	if (i >= stringLength) 
          break;
  }
  decryptedString[j] = 0;
  // code omitted
}
```
I've provided some examples below of how this is actually called within the implants code:
